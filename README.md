# Ballroom Blitz Wiki  
Success! You’ve infiltrated the coronation ball for the new King Azimuth in order to stage a coup and install yourself as monarch. Problem is, everyone else had roughly the same idea. Suddenly, someone in the back said “Everyone, attack!” and now it turned into a ballroom blitz! You figure that if you can hold the center of the room the longest, you can successfully claim the throne.

## Gameplay Objective  
Ballroom Blitz is a “King of the Hill” game. Players who stand on a control point earn 2 points for every turn they end there. Players also earn 1 point for each other player they deal fatal damage to. 

## The Ballroom 
The map is a square grid of 10x10 tiles. At the top of the map is the throne. In the middle is the control point, which is also a square grid of 2x2 tiles. At the four corners are the doors to the banquet hall.

## Control Tiles 
The control tiles are a set of tiles in the middle of the room. When a player ends a turn in one of the control tiles, they earn two points towards their score. Multiple players are allowed in the tiles, but there is a limit to the number of tiles. This incentivizes players to hunt each other and take control of the hill, as well as attempt to kill any players who try to occupy the same space. 

## Endgame
The game ends in MAX_TURN turns. At the end of the game, the victor is decided by whomever holds the most points. If there is a tie between 2 or more players, the one who holds the most gold wins. If there is a tie in gold, the winner shall be decided by a coin flip.
